# RealTimeBusTracker
## RealTimeBus Tracker Exercise
<p> The purpose of this exercise was to become familiar with mainstream developer tools that use API keys. I created a Mapbox account to generate my own access token and explore the features available for real time data fetches. In the code, I parse through an array of coordinates at a set time interval in a locked order. </p>

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
<p4> I noticed that if I press the button "Show stops..." more than once while the program runs, the marker move time speeds up considerably. A pause/start feature would be more helpful than just a flat run. I would also like to branch out and stylize the map even more, with special markers and points of interest. </p4>
